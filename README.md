# Simple Command-Line Chat Application

This is a simple Java command-line chat application that allows you to read and write to both private and public chat channels and manage your friends list. It uses text files for storing chat messages and friends' names. This application is a basic example for educational purposes and does not include a graphical user interface.

## Features

- **Private Chat**: You can read and write messages to a private chat channel. Messages are stored in the "Donut[AFK].log" file.

- **Public Chat**: You can read and write messages to a public chat channel. Messages are stored in the "Eukarte.log" file.

- **Friends List**: You can view your list of friends and add new friends. Friends' names are stored in the "friends.list" file.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Select the desired action from the menu (e.g., read from the private chat, write to the public chat, etc.).
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the application.
4. Messages are saved in the respective chat files, and your friends' list is stored in "friends.list".

## Important Notes

- Be sure to properly exit the application using option 7 to save your chat messages and the friends list.
- When adding a new friend, enter their name as instructed.
- If you encounter any issues or errors related to file operations, ensure that the text files ("Donut[AFK].log", "Eukarte.log", and "friends.list") exist in the same directory as the application.

Enjoy using this simple command-line chat application!
