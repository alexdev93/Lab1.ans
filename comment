Final Feedback:
Its one of sophesticted code I have seen as compared to what others have done , its good thing. Consider these points.
Although, there are other ways to design the classes , this is what I expect you when you design your classes:

1.
Create Interface or Abstract class ---Chat
Add abstract methods: public void write(String message)
                    : public List<String> read(String url)
					: public void display(List messages)
					: Add any other methods if you have more
2.					
Extend or implement Chat ---> create PublicChat	class		

3.
Extend PublicChat or implement Chat       --->  create PrivateChat class
 
4. Add Class Friend.
   Add method: addFriend()
             : updateFriend()
			 : deleteFriend()
			 
5. You normally have two classes for SystemExceptionHandler and CustomExceptionHandler. I expect these classes to inherit one of Exception exption classes.  So , you shouldnt extend one of these
in your Class but create instances of them and write your logs. 


6.You could have made the private chat flexible If you change the file name based on the username.
